# Employee Incentive Program Analysis

### Scenario
You are a data analyst working for a company that would like to implement wellness incentives to accomplish three goals:

1. **Boost morale:**
In a Hub International survey of 300 employee benefits professionals, 54% of them cited their employee morale metric as the one with the highest improvement after implementing a wellness program.

2. **Increase productivity:**
A work and well-being survey done by the American Psychological Association found that over 9 in 10 workers are motivated to do their best when leadership shows support for well-being efforts.

3. **Reduce absenteeism:**
Employees who maintain their physical health and manage stress are less likely to get sick or feel burned out and miss work.

Review a dataset from your company's HR department about absenteeism and health. You will use your skills to provide a data driven approach to determine how to provide a bonus and incentive to healthy employees. Develop a database and SQL queries to answer questions, and build a dashboard which meets a wireframe specification.

### Data Sources
The data you will review consists of three files provided by the HR team:
1. [Absenteeism.csv](https://github.com/Gaelim/work_incentive_program/blob/main/Absenteeism_at_work.csv)
2. [Reasons.csv](https://github.com/Gaelim/work_incentive_program/blob/main/Reasons.csv)
3. [Compensation.csv](https://github.com/Gaelim/work_incentive_program/blob/main/compensation.csv)

### Request

1. Build a database

2. Perform analysis
    - Provide a list of "healthy" individuals with low absenteeism for the *WellAtWork Incentive Program*. Employees fitting the criteria will receive a small bonus per pay period. The total budget for the program is $1,000 per pay period for all employees.

    - Calculate the hourly and annual compensation increase for non-smokers as a benefit of the *Healthy Habits Bonus Program*. The total budget is $983,221 for all employees.

3. Create a dashboard for HR to understand absenteeism at work based on an approved wireframe.
